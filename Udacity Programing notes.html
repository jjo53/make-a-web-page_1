<h1><b>Introduction to Programing Important Concepts</b></h1>
<h2>Lesson 1 Concepts: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
<p>In this first lesson we discussed how the Internet works and that <em>HTTP</em> is the protocol used between end user computers and servers.
We learned that <b>HTML <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em></b> is used for most of the content we see on the WWW. <br>HTML is made up of 
Text content - What you see<br>
Markup - What it looks like<br>
References - to  images and videos or other documents<br>
Links - to other pages</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b><br><p>HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.
<br>Computers are said to be stupid because the will only do exactly what they are instructed to do so if a programing mistake is made it can cause problems that can only be solved by the programer
</p>
<br>
<b>Inline vs. Block Elements</b>
<br>
Markups are made of Tags, an openiung tag and a closing tag. The whole thing makes up an element.
<br>
Inline  elements are made by using em, b, a, img, br, tags.
<br>
Block elements like p tag (paragraph) create an invisible box around the content.

<b>Lesson 2: Creating Structure in HTML</b></h2> <br>
<b>Learning to make a simple web page</b> <br>
* See a web page as HTML<br>
* Add structure to my page<br>
* Avoiding repetition with CSS<br>
* Making a web page look good<br>
<br>
<p> All structures are rectangular, HTML and CSS are both languages, HTML Controls structure of a page and CSS controls the style.<br>
DOM <em>Document Object Tool</em> is a tree like structure <br>
HTML ---> tags ----> elements in tree----DOM </p>
	<p>
	<b>Programing Text Editors</b></p>
	<br>
	<p>Programers often use special HTML text editor programs like Sublime, Codepen and Scratchpad.io. These programs help with formating and automatically generate closing tags when an opening tag is made</p>

<b>Lesson 3: Webpages, Documents, and Structures</b></h2> <br>
<b>Code, Test, Refine</b> <br>
* Look for natural boxes<br>
* Look for repeated styles and semantic elements<br>
* Write your HTML<br>
* Apply styles (from largest to smallest)<br>
* Fix things<br>

<b>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</b> <br>
 CSS is a style sheet language used by programers to help describe the look and formatting of an HTML document.
